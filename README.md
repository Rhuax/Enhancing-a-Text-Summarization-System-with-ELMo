( cnn ) in case you have n't noticed , we 're in the midst of 
a medical marijuana revolution . given the amount of questions 
and mystery surrounding the science behind it , dr. sanjay gupta 
wanted to provide some insight . he 's been investigating medical
marijuana for the last couple of years . his research has resulted
in three cnn documentaries , culminating with `` weed 3 : the 
marijuana revolution , '' airing at 9 p.m. et/pt sunday . gupta
opened up to questions on twitter . here 's what you wanted to
know : . how does this affect me ? readers were curious about
the effects of medical marijuana in easing symptoms of
various ailments , asking how it could help with everything 
from life-threatening illnesses and neurological conditions to
chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder . gupta pointed
out the 10 diseases where medical marijuana research could have
an impact and how it helped to stop one young girl 's severe 
seizures , and he also referenced other studies . he said that
the potential benefits of medical marijuana for people suffering
from ptsd is actually the subject of a federally approved study . 
the belief : it could suppress dream recall and allow those 
sufferers to focus on the present . there is also research into
how the drug might affect the spasms associated with people who
have multiple sclerosis . medical marijuana could also be an 
important option for those who rely on painkillers , as painkiller
overdose is the greatest preventable death in the united states
, gupta said . why do n't other doctors talk about it ? many of
the questions around medical marijuana can be tied back to the
fact that it 's just not discussed much . teaching about medica
l marijuana remains taboo in medical school . but gupta also
presented the science directly , showing what your body on weed
looks like . readers also wanted to know why people are so against 
the legalization of marijuana . decades of misinformation , gupta
said . what are the drawbacks ? with medical marijuana so misunderstood
, there naturally is a fear of potential side effects . there are
legitimate , long-term concerns with the developing brain , gupta
said , and suggested that readers seek out the research of dr. staci
gruber , who has conducted numerous studies on marijuana use and
brain function . is n't it dangerous ? when confronted with questions
rooted in fear about the dangers of medical marijuana , gupta confessed
that he used to believe the same thing -- that marijuana is dangerous
without proven benefits . after extensive research , he said he 
changed his mind on weed .

cairo ( cnn ) an egyptian court has sentenced 71 people to life in
prison for their role in the august 2013 burning of a christian 
church in the giza province village of kafr hakim , state news

leader hosni mubarak . morsy was pushed out by egypt 's military .
morsy was sentenced to 20 years in prison earlier this month after being

ian bell rescued england from a nightmare start with a century in the
first test against west indies that was pay back time for being dropped
during his last caribbean series . after his classy 143 had steered england 
to 341 for five , after they had been 34 for three , bell said that 
thoughts of him losing his place in 2009 was a big motivating factor .
bell said : ` it 's been at the back of my mind for some time that i 
got dropped the last time i was here for a test series . so i wanted to
make this one count and it was very satisfying to do so . i deserved to
be dropped at the time and i did a lot of hard yards to get back in . 
' ian bell scored 143 on the first day of the first test against west
indies in antigua on monday . the 33-year-old kisses the england badge
on his helmet after his 22nd test match century . and bell rates his 
hundred one of the best of his 22 -- only alastair cook -lrb- 25 -rrb- ,
out for another low score , and kevin pietersen -lrb- 23 -rrb- have
scored more . bell shared century partnerships of 177 with joe root ,
who made 83 and another one of 130 with ben stokes who is 71 not out . 
` it has to be right up there , ' said bell . it does n't get much better .
the partnership with joe root was just what we needed . but the west 
indies bowled very well for the first two hours . and ben stokes made
it a brilliant finish to the day . ' bell was dropped from the side on 
his last visit to the caribbean in 2009 . bell put on 177 for the fourth
wicket with joe root and added 130 for the fifth wicket with ben stokes . 
' it was my day today , but hopefully it will be someone else 's day in 
the next innings . ` for me , it was nice - coming here in 2009 , 
this was where i got dropped after our shemozzle in jamaica , so i was
determined to come out and play as well as i could . ` it was nice to 
come back and put things right . ' bell raises his bat after being dismissed 
for 143 in the evening session on day one in antigua . kemar roach runs
away to celebrate bowling alastair cook out for 11 on the first morning
of the test . cook , who has n't added to his record haul of 25 centuries
since may 2013 , was bowled by kemar roach for 11 falling again to a
good length ball outside off stump . roach said : ` cook has a weakness 
there , everyone knows it . we let them get away a bit , but bell batted 
very well . ' the other two england disappointments were a nervous-looking
jonathan trott who lasted just three deliveries on his return from 
` situational anxiety ' , and gary ballance , who also fell to a poor shot .

the former chairman of bradford city was linked to eight other fires 
before the valley parade blaze that killed 56 , a new book has claimed .
author martin fletcher claims the devastating fire was not an accident
and has revealed a sequence of other blazes at businesses owned by or 
associated with stafford heginbotham , the club 's chairman at the time .
after an inquiry , high court judge mr justice popplewell said the fire 
was not started deliberately and was caused by a discarded cigarette .
west yorkshire police today said in a statement that they would review
any fresh evidence surrounding the tragedy . scroll down for video . 
tragedy : the fire at bradford city 's valley parade claimed 56 victims
and injured 265 on may 11 , 1985 . then-bradford chairman heginbotham
-lrb- left -rrb- was linked to eight other fires before the valley parade
blaze , it has been claimed . fletcher , a survivor of the blaze , spent
15 years researching the disaster in which his brother andrew , 11 , his
father john , 34 , his uncle peter , 32 , and his grandfather eddie , 63
, were all killed . he was 12 at the time and after painstaking 
investigation of public documents has published his findings in his
book : ` fifty-six -- the story of the bradford fire ' , serialised
in the guardian . the fire broke out near half-time of bradford 's 
game against lincoln on may 11 , 1985 , and was thought to have been
started by a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a 
gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish 
which had been collecting for years . within four minutes the stand
was completely ablaze . the fire was thought to have been started by
a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden
frame of the main stand . the fire broke out near half-time in bradford
's game . within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze . the fire
, in 1985 , engulfed the stand within minutes . the 30th anniversary of
the incident is approaching . then-bradford chairman stafford heginbotham
-lrb- left -rrb- with mr justice popplewell in front of the burned stand 
. the judge said the fire was not started deliberately and was caused by
a discarded cigarette . devastating : the deadly fire broke out near 
half-time during bradford 's game against lincoln on may 11 , 1985 .
a police officer uses his helmet to shield the heat from his face as
he runs in front of the burning stand . his research includes claims
that heginbotham , who died in 1995 at the age of 61 , had been 
connected to other fires at business premises over a period of the 
previous 18 years , which resulted in large insurance claims . the 
book , published on thursday , does not make any direct allegations
but mr fletcher says heginbotham 's history with fires , which he 
claims resulted in payouts totalling around # 27 million in today 's
terms , warranted further investigation . it was the worst stadium fire
in the history of british football and prompted important safety changes 
in grounds across the land . the final of game of the season should have
been a day of celebration for bradford city . before kick-off the team
were presented with the trophy for winning the third division title as 
11,076 fans watched on . but instead , may 11 , 1985 ended in tragedy 
as flames engulfed the main stand at valley parade . the valley parade
blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of british
football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the
land . the fire was noticed at 3.40 pm towards the end of the first 
half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was 
fully ablaze . the disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further
265 injured . in the years that followed , new legislation was 
introduced governing safety at the nation 's sports grounds . the 
tragedy brought about an unprecedented community spirit in the city ,
with , among many other initiatives , a fundraising drive for the
burns unit at bradford royal infirmary . in 2010 , on the 25th 
anniversary , there were an estimated two thousand at the service
in the city 's centenary square but this year there has been such 
a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to valley
parade . ` could any man really be as unlucky as heginbotham ? ' 
wrote mr fletcher . ` from standing around with a bunch of kids and 
onlookers on a sunday afternoon in may 1967 , as his former foam-cushion
business went up in flames , to standing on the pitch at valley 
parade 18 years later , making noises about smoke bombs while 56
people perished behind him . ' a 12-year-old martin fletcher is 
comforted by his mother susan in 1985 after the bradford fire disaster
. he has spent years researching the disaster . survivor looks distraught
with his burns visible -lrb- left -rrb- while another sits in front of a
burned out stand . the release of the book coincides with the 30th 
anniversary of the disaster , with english football set for a minute
's silence ahead of all games on april 25 , which will be bradford 
's closest home fixture to the date and is bound to cause much
consternation in the west yorkshire city . 1 : may 1967 : fire in
stafford heginbotham 's factory at cutler heights lane . 2 : april 1968 
: fire at genefoam ltd , managing director is heginbotham . 3 : 
august 1970 : store-room explosion at matgoods , founded by heginbotham 
. 4 : dec 1971 : tenant fire at castle mills , cleckheaton , owned by 
heginbotham . 5 : august 1977 : fire at yorkshire knitting mills , in 
heginbotham-owned douglas mills building . 6 : dec 1977 : fire at 
coronet marketing factory . coronet a subsidiary of tebro toys
, owned by heginbotham . 7 : nov 1977 : fire with toxic fumes at his
douglas mills factory . 8 : june 1981 : fire in a plastics factory at 
douglas mills . no-one sought accountability for the fire once the
official popplewell inquiry had recorded its findings following a 
series of hearings held less than a month after the blaze . but mr
fletcher started to investigate nine years after the disaster ,
scouring back-copies of the local paper , the telegraph and argus for
information . sir olive popplewell told sky news today that he was not
aware of the previous links to fires in 1985 . he said they were a ` 
remarkable coincidence ' but that it did not alter his ruling that the
tragedy was an ` accident exacerbated by negligence ' . he added : `
if we had been aware of these fires at the time of course they would 
have demanded further investigation , but i am not sure what they would
have revealed . ' former sports minister gerry sutcliffe said today 
that the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry in to the disaster
. mr sutcliffe , mp for bradford south and deputy leader of bradford 
city council at the time of the tragedy , says he knew heginbotham 
` flew by the seat of his pants ' in terms of the finances of the club 
but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court 
judge mr justice popplewell that the fire was an accident . prime
minister margaret thatcher visits the scene of the disaster with her
husband dennis in 1985 . tributes were paid to the 56 who were killed 
by the fire on the same day bradford should have been celebrating . 
the remains of the stand at bradford 's ground after the disaster on
saturday may 11 , 1985 at valley parade . his many businesses included
toy company tebro toys . he once described football as ` the opera
of the people ' . after an initial spell as bradford chairman , he 
came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman , jack tordoff 
, saved bradford from the receivers , buying the club for around
# 30,000 each . heginbotham resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill 
health . he died on april 21 1995 after a heart transplant . he was 61 .
mr sutcliffe told press association sport : ` the inquiry by mr justice
popplewell concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in 
what was an old wooden stand and i have not heard anything to convince
me that that was not the case . ` stafford heginbotham was one of 
those football club chairmen of which there were many at the time who
flew by the seat of his pants . i was deputy leader of the city council
at the time and he did fly by the seat of his pants when it came to 
paying the bill for the police and so on . ` but i think the inquiry
was very thorough at the time and i do n't think there needs to be 
another because of this . i do not believe there was any sort of 
cover-up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations
on stadiums that together with the taylor report came up with the 
right answers for football . mr fletcher started to investigate 
after a conversation with his mother nine years after the disaster
, when she told him it had not been heginbotham 's first fire . 
the charred remains of a bradford programme from the day of the
fire in which 56 people were killed . ` there will always be
speculation but i just think it was a tragedy that cost the lives
of 56 people and injured many more , and has scarred the city for 
many years . ' author martin fletcher writes about his own experience
at the bradford disaster , and asks why chairman stafford heginbotham 
was not investigated : . ` why was it left to the 12-year-old who
lost three generations and four members of his family , who was 
with over 40 people when they died within a 10-yard radius of him , 
who somehow got out of the stand , as the last person to get out ,
the only person to get out the front after being at the back , and
the only person to survive the smoke ? ' heginbotham 's son , james ,
47 , told the daily mirror today : ` when you actually do your homework 
and see what he did for bradford city football club it is a sickening
accusation . it is just absolutely ridiculous . ` he never recovered 
from the fire . the stress of it is what killed him eventually . 
it was a shock hearing this today , it was such a long time ago .
` he 's no longer here to defend himself . it 's a real shame it 
has come to this . ` he devoted his entire life to that club . he
saved the club on two separate occasions . ' i have never seen 
anybody more passionate about anything than he was about that club 
. ' according to the independent , it would be up to home secretary
theresa may to order a new inquiry but this would not be unlikely 
to happen before the election next month .

it seems to happen after every single world cup that someone near 
to the top of english cricket gets the sack . whether it be duncan
fletcher , david lloyd , whoever , someone always seems to pay the
price for our abject failure to compete on the global one-day stage 
. paul downton is just the latest victim . it is high time that we 
looked at the entire structure of english cricket and the reasons 
we are incapable of producing the types of cricketer required to 
succeed in international one-day cricket . paul downton has left 
his role as managing director of england and wales cricket board . 
moores -lrb- from left to right -rrb- , downton and england
captain alastair cook during the press conference . the system is
broken and it desperately needs fixing if england are ever going 
to compete in limited-overs cricket again . make no mistake , 
sacking paul downton does not mean some magic wand has been waved
and all will be well . there are deep systemic problems . too many 
of the current selectors and coaches are from the old guard and
have failed to keep pace with the dramatic changes that have 
occurred in one-day cricket in recent years . from downton to 
coach peter moores , to selectors james whitaker and angus fraser
, these are players from a different era who have been painfully 
slow to react to situations . downton -lrb- left -rrb- and peter
moores -lrb- right -rrb- pose during a press conference at lord 
's cricket ground . downton leaves his role as ecb managing
director following england 's shameful performance at world cup 
. even the sacking of alastair cook as one-day captain was a
slow and protracted affair . they should have acted sooner . 
like so much of english sport , our cricket system seems afraid
of the maverick player and that has to change . in my view there
is still too much bad blood around for kevin pietersen to return 
, with the fall-out from the book causing untold damage to so
many relationships that it just seems inconceivable for him to
return . nasser hussain believes the sacking of cook as one-day 
captain was a slow and protracted affair . i hate it when things
become about one individual and believe me , everything that has
gone wrong with english cricket has not been down to the handling 
of kevin pietersen ; however badly that has been done . but what 
is does highlight is the continued fear of the maverick player . 
from david gower to kevin pietersen , english cricket has shown 
distrust for anyone who does not conform or fit into a safe
stereotype even though all the players who are thriving on 
the world stage are non-conformists who do things differently .
you would n't find brendan mccullum or ab de villiers audacious 
shot - making in an mcc coaching manual but you will not find 
two better strikers of a cricket ball on the planet . english 
cricket needs to learn to embrace the maverick . pietersen has
rejoined surrey in the hope of earning a place in the ashes 
squad for england this summer . hussain hopes whoever is
appointed to replace downton is close to the modern game and
ahead of the curve . i have been asked if i would like to 
take on downton 's job and the short answer is ` no ' . i 
will do anything i can to help the ecb and english cricket 
but there are far better candidates than me out there . whether
it be michael vaughan , andrew strauss or anyone else , i just
hope whoever they appoint is close to the modern game and ahead 
of the curve . we have been behind it for far too long.most 
importantly , it is time to wake up and look at the big picture 
. stop finding individuals to scapegoat and carry the can and 
start looking at the system that is failing to produce the kind 
of cricketers we need .

olympic leaders stopped short sunday of imposing a complete ban on
russia from the rio de janeiro games , assigning individual global
sports federations the responsibility to decide which athletes 
should be cleared to compete . the decision , announced after a 
three-hour meeting via teleconference of the international olympic
committee 's executive board , came just 12 days before the aug. 
5 opening of the games . `` we had to balance the collective
responsibility and the individual justice to which every human being
and athlete is entitled to , '' ioc president thomas bach said .
the ioc rejected calls from the world anti-doping agency and dozens 
of other anti-doping bodies to exclude the entire russian olympic 
team following allegations of state-sponsored cheating . russia 's 
track and field athletes have already been banned by the iaaf , 
the sport 's governing body , a decision that was upheld thursday
by the court of arbitration for sport , and was accepted by the ioc
again on sunday . calls for a complete ban on russia intensified 
after richard mclaren , a canadian lawyer commissioned by wada , 
issued a report monday accusing russia 's sports ministry of 
overseeing a vast doping program of its olympic athletes . mclaren 
's investigation , based heavily on evidence from former moscow
doping lab director grigory rodchenkov , affirmed allegations of
brazen manipulation of russian urine samples at the 2014 winter
games in sochi , but also found that state-backed doping had i
nvolved 28 summer and winter sports from 2011 to 2015. but the ioc
board decided against the ultimate sanction , in line with bach 's 
recent statements stressing the need to take individual justice 
into account . the ioc said the mclaren report had made no direct 
accusations against the russian olympic committee `` as an
institution . '' `` an athlete should not suffer and should not 
be sanctioned for a system in which he was not implicated ,
'' bach told reporters on a conference call after sunday 's meeting
. the ioc also said russia is barred from entering for the rio
games any athlete who has ever been sanctioned for doping . in a 
statement , the ioc said it would accept the entry of only those 
russian athletes who meet certain conditions set out for the 28 
international federations to apply . it also rejected the application
by russian whistleblower yulia stepanova , the 800-meter runner 
and former doper who helped expose the doping scandal in her homeland 
, to compete under a neutral flag at the games . however , the ioc 
added that it would invite her and her husband , vitaly stepanov , 
to attend the games .
